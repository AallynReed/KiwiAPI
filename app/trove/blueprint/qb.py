"""Qubicle Binary (``.qb``) with Trove's material maps -- the authoring format.

Trove's modding pipeline is four ``.qb`` files, not one: a base model carrying colour,
and three *material maps* at identical dimensions whose voxel colours encode what the
material is. ``foo.qb`` + ``foo_a.qb`` (alpha) + ``foo_s.qb`` (specular) + ``foo_t.qb``
(type) compile to one ``.blueprint``, and this module goes both ways.

The map palettes below are Trove's, taken from Troxel (chrmoritz/Troxel), the community
editor modders have used against the real game for years:

    type (_t)      solid (255,255,255) · glass (128,128,128) · tiled glass (64,64,64)
                   glowing solid (255,0,0) · glowing glass (255,255,0)
    specular (_s)  rough (128,0,0) · metal (0,128,0) · water (0,0,128)
                   iridescent (128,128,0) · waxy (128,0,128)
    alpha (_a)     grey 16 + 32*level for glass, white for solid
    attachment     magenta (255,0,255) in ALL FOUR maps

The attachment point is the one thing that doesn't survive as a voxel. A blueprint keeps
it as the model's origin (see ``codec.attachment_point``), and a ``.qb`` keeps it BOTH as
a magenta voxel and as a negative matrix-position offset -- Troxel reads it back as
``-dx, -dy, -dz``, which is the same trick from the other end. Export writes both so the
file works whichever way a tool reads it; import accepts either.

Coordinates: this module works in the codec's decoded frame throughout, which IS the
Qubicle frame -- that's what "the X axis is mirrored relative to Qubicle" in the codec
means, and the mirror is already applied by the time voxels reach here.
