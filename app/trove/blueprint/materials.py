"""The voxel material model the editor edits: ``(type, w)`` directly.

Trove stores a material as two numbers per voxel -- a u16 ``type`` and a u8 ``w`` --
and the ``_t``/``_a``/``_s`` QB maps modders author against are *derived* from that
pair, not stored. Editing through those maps means going ``(type, w) -> 3 colours ->
(type, w)``, and that trip is lossy: 21 of the 55 pairs the live catalogue actually
uses do not come back the same. Two of them matter a lot -- type 39 (the deco
placeholder) collapses to plain solid, taking the build's furniture with it, and a
solid with ``w=7`` loses its ``w``. So this editor edits the pair itself and leaves the
derived maps to the export path, where a lossy conversion is the user's explicit choice.

Three classes of voxel, and the distinction is the whole point:

* **UGC palette** (``PALETTE``) -- the five types a modder can author, with ``w``
  meaning specular finish on solids and opacity on glass. Fully editable.
* **Known internal** (``INTERNAL_NAMES``) -- types the game uses that aren't in the
  UGC palette but that we can name. Shown by name, preserved verbatim.
* **Unknown** -- anything else. Shown as its raw type number, preserved verbatim, and
  never silently reinterpreted. Not knowing what a voxel is, and saying so, beats
  guessing it into a solid block.
