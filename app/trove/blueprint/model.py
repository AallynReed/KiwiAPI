"""Model projects: a whole creature open in the Blueprint Editor at once.

A Trove model is not one file. A mount is a head, a jaw, four legs, a body and a tail,
each its own ``.blueprint``, and the game assembles them onto a skeleton at runtime.
The editor opened one at a time, so recolouring a dragon meant sixteen open-edit-save
rounds with no way to see the thing you were actually making.

This opens the whole set: every ``.blueprint`` inside a ``.tmod``/``.zip`` (or a pile
of loose files) is decoded into the same payload ``editor.inspect`` returns, and each
one is told WHERE it sits - the attach point on the rig, from the game's own prefab
bindings. The page then draws the assembled creature, edits one part at a time, and
posts the lot back to be written into a rebuilt mod.

Stateless like the rest of the editor: the archive arrives with the request, the parts
go back with the response, and the save carries the original archive again. Nothing is
held between the two.

**The rig is resolved authoritatively or not at all** (``rig_index.resolve``, from the
binfab bindings the game ships). A part the map doesn't place comes back ``ap: null``
and the page lays it out beside the model rather than guessing a bone for it - a wrong
bone is a model that looks assembled and isn't.
