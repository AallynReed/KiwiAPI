"""Trove Creations checks for a ``.blueprint``.

A port of Troxel's ``TroveCreationsLint`` (chrmoritz/Troxel), which encodes the
Trove Creations submission guidelines - the rules a model has to satisfy before the
game will hold it the right way round and the subreddit will accept it. Troxel checks
authored ``.qb`` files; this checks the compiled blueprint, which changes three things:

* **The attachment point isn't a voxel any more.** In a ``.qb`` it's a magenta
  (255, 0, 255) voxel with the sentinel material ``t=7, s=7, a=250``. The compiler
  consumes it: not one of the 72,584 blueprints in the live catalogue contains a
  magenta voxel. It survives as the model's ORIGIN instead - see
  ``codec.attachment_point`` - so "exactly one attachment point" can't be violated
  here, and the position checks work off the origin.
* **Two of Troxel's rules cannot fail.** "Alpha on a solid voxel" and "specular on a
  non-solid voxel" describe a ``.qb`` carrying three independent material maps that
  can disagree. A blueprint stores one ``(type, w)`` pair where ``w`` *is* the
  specular index on a solid and *is* the opacity on glass, so the contradiction has
  nowhere to live. Reported as satisfied rather than silently dropped.
* **"Too dark" skips procedural voxels.** Terrain and friends legitimately store
  near-black - the game tints them at runtime - so flagging them would be noise.

Sizes below are in the blueprint's own frame. Troxel's bounding box includes the
attachment voxel and the gap beneath a hat/mask, so its published limits read
``20x14x20`` for a hat "but yours is x, y-6, z"; that ``y-6`` is exactly our ``sy``,
and the x/z limits carry over unchanged.
