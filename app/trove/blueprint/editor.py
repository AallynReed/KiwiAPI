"""The Blueprint Editor's engine: inspect a ``.blueprint``, apply edits, re-encode.

Stateless by design. A file arrives with the request, the answer goes back with the
response, and nothing is kept -- on save the browser posts the original bytes back
alongside the edits, so the server never has to hold a session between the two.

Edits are indexed against the decoded voxel order, which the codec keeps stable
(v5 by linear index, v3/v4 by file order). The same file always decodes to the same
sequence, so an index means the same voxel on the save request as it did on the
inspect response -- and an untouched voxel is written back byte for byte, because the
encoder is handed the original ``(type, w)`` it decoded.
