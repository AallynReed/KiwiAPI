"""Rotate and mirror a blueprint.

Turning a model is the fix for the commonest thing the Trove Creations checks report -
"the model is facing the wrong way" - so the two belong together. Three things have to
move with the geometry, and getting any of them wrong breaks the model quietly:

* **The bounding box.** A quarter turn swaps two axes, and v5 addresses voxels by a
  linear index computed from that box, so the box has to be rebuilt before encoding.

* **The attachment point.** It lives in the model's origin, not in a voxel, so nothing
  about it moves on its own. Rotate a sword without rotating its grip and the game keeps
  holding it by a point that is now somewhere out in the air. It transforms by the same
  formula as a voxel, including when it sits outside the box (a hat's does).

* **Placed decos.** A cornerstone's entity section stores model-local positions that line
  up with the type-39 placeholder voxels. Rotating the voxels and leaving the entities
  put would slide every piece of furniture out of its socket. Their coordinates are
  rewritten too, and if the entity section can't be parsed exactly the transform is
  refused rather than performed half-way.

Materials are scalars, so they simply travel with their voxel. Rotations are 90 degrees
clockwise looking down the named axis; apply one twice for 180.
