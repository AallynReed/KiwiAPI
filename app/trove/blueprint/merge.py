"""Flatten a stack of blueprints into one.

Trove has no layered model format, so the file that comes out is always a single
``.blueprint``. Layering is an editing-time idea, and that is exactly what makes it
useful: **nothing is destroyed while you work**. A model laid over another hides what is
underneath rather than replacing it, so sliding it back off brings the covered voxels
straight back. The stack is only resolved at output, and the stacking ORDER is what
decides which voxel wins a shared cell - the topmost layer that has one.

**Alignment is the hard part.** Two models are two independent grids, each starting at
(0, 0, 0), and stacking them corner-to-corner is almost never what anyone means. The
default is Troxel's rule: line the ATTACHMENT POINTS up. Both models are already defined
relative to where the game holds them, so a sword hilt meets a sword hilt and a hat brim
meets a hat brim without anyone counting voxels. Centre and corner are there for models
that have no attachment point (v3/v4, decorations), and a manual nudge rides on top of
whichever is chosen.

Everything a move has to carry, flattening has to carry for every layer:

* **The box** grows to hold all of them, and if any lands at a negative coordinate the
  whole grid shifts, because a blueprint's grid starts at zero.
* **The attachment point** of the BASE survives as the result's own - the output is the
  base model with things added, so it keeps its grip.
* **Placed decos** from every layer are translated and concatenated, so a cornerstone
  flattened with another keeps the furniture from both.

Materials cross over untouched, including the ones the palette refuses to edit: this is
a file-level operation, not a paint stroke, so a deco placeholder stays a deco
placeholder rather than being reinterpreted as a solid block.
