/* Kiwi voxel scene - renderer, camera, orbit/pan/zoom and voxel picking.

   The turntable half of a voxel viewer, with nothing about *what* is being shown.
   `blueprint_viewer.js` and `model_viewer.js` each grew their own copy of this
   (identical down to the comments); the Blueprint Editor needs the same camera plus
   the ability to say which voxel is under the cursor, so it lives here once instead
   of being typed a third time. Those two still carry their own copies and can adopt
   this later - nothing here is viewer-specific.

   What it adds over the two originals is `pick`: a raycast that resolves to a voxel
   COORDINATE rather than a triangle. The mesher merges faces into a handful of
   material groups, so a hit gives no voxel index back - but every face sits exactly
   half a unit out from its voxel's centre along the face normal, so stepping back
   in along that normal and rounding lands on the voxel, and stepping out lands on
   the empty cell in front of it.

     var scene = window.VoxelScene.create({ stage: el, data: payload });
     scene.rebuild(payload);        // after an edit
     var hit = scene.pick(event);   // { x, y, z, nx, ny, nz } | null
     scene.dispose();

   CONTROLS DEFAULT TO THE VIEWERS'. A plain left-drag orbits unless a host calls
   `setDragMode`, and only the Blueprint Editor does - so the scheme where the left
   button belongs to a tool and the view is turned some other way is its own. Nothing
   here changes how `blueprint_viewer.js` or `model_viewer.js` behave; they carry their
   own copies of the camera and this file is not loaded on their pages. Keep it that
   way: a viewer where dragging suddenly painted would be a bad surprise.

   WHICH gesture turns the view is a preset - `setNavScheme`, one of the three names in
   `VoxelScene.SCHEMES`. See NAV_SCHEMES below for what each one binds and why there is
   a choice at all rather than one right answer.

   Requires three.js plus voxel_mesh.js, and uses viewer_stage.js when present. */

    /* ---- overlays: an outline drawn around a set of voxels ------------------
       Used for the attachment point (which is usually NOT a voxel - on a hat it
       floats below the model), for the selection, for the box preview and to point
       at voxels a check complained about.

       It outlines the SET, not each voxel in it. Wireframing every cube turns any
       real selection into graph paper: on a flat face you see the grid, not the
       shape, and a thousand-voxel wing is a solid haze of blue. So only the edges
       that sit on a crease of the set's surface survive - which on a flat run is
       one straight line down the far side of it, and over the whole set is the
       outline of its volume. Two rules, and nothing else:

         - an edge is a candidate only where it borders an EXPOSED face, one whose
           neighbouring cell is outside the set. Everything buried inside is gone.
         - a candidate is dropped when exactly two exposed faces meet along it and
           they face the same way, because that is flat surface rather than an edge.
           One face means a boundary, and two facing differently is a real 90° turn:
           both are drawn, so bumps, holes and thin plates all keep their outline.

       Still one merged LineSegments pair rather than a mesh per voxel: a finding can
       cover thousands of voxels, and that has to stay a couple of draw calls. */
